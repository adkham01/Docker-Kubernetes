- Kubernetes: The whole orchestration system
  - K8s "k-eights" or Kube for short
- Kubectl: CLI to configure Kubernetes and manage apps 
  - Using "cube control" official pronunciation
- Node: Single server in the Kubernetes cluster
- Kublet: Kubernetes agent running on nodes
- Control Plane: Set of containers that manage the cluster
  - Includes API serverr, scheduler, controller manager, etc, and more.
  - Sometimes called the master

 Kubernetes Container Abstractoin
 --------------------------------
- Pod: one or more containers running togeter on one Node
  - Basic unit of deployment. Containers a always in pods 
- Controller: For creating/updating pods and other objects
  - Many    types of Controllers inc. Deployment, ReplicaSet, StatefulSet,
    DaemonSet, Job, CroneJob, etc.
- Service: network endpoint to connect to a pod 
- Namespace: Filtered group of objects in cluster 
- Secrets, ConfigMaps, and more.

 Scaling ReplicaSets
 -------------------
- Start a new deployment for one replica/pod 
  > kubectl create deployment my-apache --image httpd
- Check our resource statis
  > kubectl get all 
- Let's scale it up with another pod
  > kubectl scale deploy/my-apache --replicas 2
  > kubectl scale deploy my-apache --replicas 2
- those are the same command
- deploy = deployment = deplyments

 Watching Resources
 ------------------
- Current commands give us a point-in-time status 
- On, Linux we might use a watch kubectl get pods command
- But kubectl has -w (--watch) built-in!

 Basic Service Types 
 -------------------
- ClusterIP(default):
  - Single, internal virtual IP allocated
  - Only reachable from within cluster (notes and pods)
  - Pods can reach service on apps port number
- NodePort:
  - High port allocated on each node
  - Port is open on every node's IP
  - Anyone can connect (if they can reach node)
  - Other pods need to be update to this port 
- These services are always available in Kubernetes 
- LoadBalancer:
  - Controls a LB endpoint external to the cluster
  - Only available when infra provider gives you a LB(AWS ELB, etc)
  - Creates NodePort+ClusterIP services, tells LB to send to NodePort
- ExternalName:
  - Adds CNAME DNS record to CoreDNS only
  - Not used for Pods, fut for giving outside Kubernetes
