difference between Image vs.Container

if we do rm -f running container will be removed

Persistent Data: Bind Voluming
Persistent Data: Bind Mounting
FROM - lets me select base image always needed to start the build
ENV - environment variables and layer build statements in the container created 
from that image
WORKDIR - Propper way to change the directory
COPY - for copying the source files 
RUN - universal way to run any commands inside the container image
EXPOSE tells which port created apllication needs to listen on
CMD - default command when the command executes
it will store container metadata and it will run when I start the container image

ENTRYPOINT ["./startup.sh]
CMD ["phyton", "app.py"]

RUN -> use shell by default
ENTRYPOINT -> Always use Exec 
CMD -> use Exec by default
